`git-steal` is the best way to quickly deploy high-quality projects on GitHub.

Why struggle through learning to code and creating something worthwhile when plenty of people have already done it?

**Just copy someone else's code and take credit for it!**

Most devs have to go through the entire software development process. This is a long journey (with six whole steps! **SIX!**)

It involves:

1. Coming up with a good idea.
2. Planning your implementation.
3. Developing the program.
4. Testing your code.
5. Refining it to fix any bugs you discover in testing.
6. Releasing the software, and hoping to be recognized for your hard work and dedication.

With `git-steal`, you can skip directly to step 6!

## Inspiration

A few days ago, I found a copy one of my open-source personal projects, [`shallow-backup`](https://www.github.com/alichtman/shallow-backup) on someone else's GitHub profile. Now, this is exactly how the open source community should work! When you find a project you'd like to contribute to, you fork it and open pull requests to the master repo.

Except, this wasn't exactly how my project was copied...

The repo I found had (near) identical source code to what was in my repo, except all the information that identified me as the author was removed.

The plagiarizing developer had stripped out:

1. Author tags I left at the top of the source code
2. MIT license in my name
3. Credit for a block of code written by a good friend of mine

Additionally, she had replaced every instance of `shallow-backup` with a cheeky new name, `keepsies`, and swapped in a new ASCII splash graphic. (Hey there, [@gretzky](https://github.com/gretzky), how's it goin'?)
